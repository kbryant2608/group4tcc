Salaries of Different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain, sourced from Kaggle.

**Introduction**

This dataset was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023), and includes data spanning from 2020-2023 "Salaries of Different Data Science Fields in the Data Science Domain."
The primary objective of our analysis was:
1. To evaluate how experience level affects salary in different job roles.
2. To determine if/how the predictability of salary varies with employee rank, and what factors, such as experience level, might contribute to these variations in predictability across different types of employees.

**Executive Summary**

The data was cleaned and prepared for modeling, addressing issues such as missing values and data type inconsistencies. Minimal encoding was necessary. Multiple models were tested in order to predict outcomes based on the processed data, comparing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective model.
